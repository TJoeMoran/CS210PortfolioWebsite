            Hi everyone, my name is Joseph Moran. I am a sophomore at North Idaho College, and 
            I will graduate with my Computer Science AS next spring. I love the outdoors, and 
            I have a particular passion for mountaineering. My favorite climb so far is Mt. Rainier
            in Washington State. Some of my other hobbies include math, pickleball, and weightlifting.
            After I finish my associate's degree at NIC, I plan to transfer to a four-year school 
            (not sure where yet) to study actuarial science and data analysis with a minor in computer
            science. Once I graduate, my goal is to become a certified actuary. 
          
            While you're here, check out my projects page. It includes examples of my most 
            challenging projects from my last three semesters of computer science. I've included 
            projects coded in C, C++, Python, and assembly language. </p>
