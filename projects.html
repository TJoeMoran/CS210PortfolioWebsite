                    this as a group project with 3 classmates. It's coded 
                    entirely in C++. The game allows the user to play Battleship
                    against the computer. It lets the user place their
                    ships manually or randomly. It tracks and displays hits, misses,
                    and sunk ships and reports the winner at the end. It also 
                    reports the result of each move to a log file. </p>

                    This is my stegoBMP command line steganography tool
                    for CS-151. Steganography is the process of concealing a 
                    message or other file within a file. This tool works with 
                    24-bit uncompressed BMP image files to either encode or 
                    decode messages. It utilizes the unused bits in the binary 
                    code of the image to store a message, and it can also decode
                    from an image that contains a hidden message. </p>

                    This is my assembly language calculator that I wrote
                    for my CS-155 final project. It's a basic calculator 
                    that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
                    and integer division on two-digit values (00 - 99). 
                    It performs input validation, checks for divide by 0 errors, 
                    and loops until user chooses to quit the program.</p>

                    or tokens and labels them by type (comment, keyword, operator, etc.).
                    This lexer is written in C and was tested using programs written
                    in CCX, an imaginary language with syntax similar to C and C++. </p>
